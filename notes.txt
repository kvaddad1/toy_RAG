* LlamaIndex is a popular data framework that helps developers build applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's what it does:

-Data Connection
Helps connect LLMs to your private or external data sources
Supports various data types like PDFs, documents, APIs, databases

-Data Processing
Creates efficient indexes of your data
Structures information in a way that LLMs can easily understand and use
Handles data chunking and embedding creation

-Retrieval
Helps find relevant information from your data when needed
Enables semantic search through your documents
Supports different querying strategies

-Application Building
Makes it easier to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications
Provides tools for question-answering systems
Helps create chatbots that can access your specific data

In summary, LlamaIndex is a dataframework that processes your raw data (private data like documents, PDFs, etc.)
It uses embedding models to convert text chunks into vectors
These vectors are stored in a vector database (like Milvus or Qdrant)
When a query comes in, the system:
Converts the query to a vector
Uses the vector database to find similar vectors (relevant information)
Retrieves the matching original text
Sends this context to the LLM for final response

[Your private data -> LlamaIndex -> Vector Database -> LLM Application] 
- LlamaIndex → Uses External Embedding Models → Gets Vector Embeddings
             (like OpenAI's API, HuggingFace models, Cohere's API)

- LlamaIndex → Uses External Embedding Models → Gets Vector Embeddings - Vector databases
              (like OpenAI's API, HuggingFace models, Cohere's API)

* Hugging Face is like an app store → You download models and run them yourself, whereas Cohere is like a web service → You make API calls to use their models

* Vector databases examples for instance: 
- Milvus:
Open-source vector database built for massive scale
Strong at handling billions of vectors
Supports multiple similarity metrics (Euclidean, Inner Product, etc.)
Written in Go and C++
Often used in very large production deployments
Has both standalone and cluster modes
Good for complex hybrid searches (combining vector and scalar queries)

-Qdrant:
Vector database written in Rust
Generally simpler to set up and use
Very fast for medium-sized deployments
Excellent built-in filtering capabilities
Strong focus on payload management
Great for getting started and smaller to medium deployments
Has a particularly clean API design
Good documentation and easier learning curve
